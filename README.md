# Attendance App

This project is an attendance management application that allows users to submit attendance appeals and track their status. It serves as a simplified version of HERE, a production-level system used by thousands of students and staff. The goal of this project is to showcase the programming skills required to contribute to the team responsible for maintaining and developing HERE.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

To start the project, simply run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Demo
1. Start by accessing http://localhost:3000/submit-appeal.
2. Fill out the form to submit an appeal.
3. The browser will then redirect you to /appeals-list if the appeal is successfully created.
4. You can approve the appeal simply by clicking the "Approve" button on the list.
